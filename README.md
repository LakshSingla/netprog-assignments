### Assumptions

- No interactive commands (eg ssh)
- No shell propterties (eg env) changing commands except cd
- Any command (cd) etc or File names in the commands should not have dot in their name
- ./client should be opened in the home directory of the user logged in n1, else the server will continue to execute in the directory in which the shell is opened
